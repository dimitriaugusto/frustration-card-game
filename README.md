# frustration-card-game-companion
This is not a game. It's an Android app to support
playing of Frustration (card game).

Find it on Play Store (Android phones):
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dimiaug.frustration

You need 2 standard 52-card decks and at least 3
players. Reach me for playing instructions. :-D

# notes on design and architecure
You will find here a very-well-structured, clean
code with strong separation of concerns.

Currently it miserably (and purposedly) lacks clean
architecture concepts. :-)
